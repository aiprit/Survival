Game to build

genre: 2D platform game
Name: Survival
Goal : You start off as a small blob amongst a sea of different blob sizes, your goal is to absorb other smaller blobs
 and grow bigger while also avoiding the bigger ones from absorbing you until you are the biggest/only organism left on the field.
Basic mechanics: up down left right directions, similar to other games to dodge. May have a pause button.
Levels : level 1 simple blobs with majority being small
 	     level 2 Ratio of smaller to larger units increase. Movements of blobs increase
		 level 3 You yourself also would slowly decrease in size with time, thus you could come to the point where
				 you could no longer win the level if you take too long. 
		 level 4 boss level which is a circle that throws a bunch of circles at you which you may dodge/absorb until you are bigger enough to 
			     absorb the boss
Modes: Insane mode with flipped controls for harder difficulty.
 	   Infinite mode, you try to stay alive in environment while collecting smaller blobs. 
 	   You do not grow, smaller blobs may respawn infinitely while the speed of the blobs slowly increases.
Cheats: button to automatically increase/decrease size.

Implementation Ideas: blobs would spawn at edge of screen and bounce around randomly. You start in the middle.
						Use detect intersects then sum the two sizes of blob to make player bigger (maybe a ratio).
						etc
